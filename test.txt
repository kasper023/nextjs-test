Develop a theme configuration system within a Next.js application, enabling runtime theme switching without a page reload.

Specifications:
Theme Configuration:
Define at least two distinct themes (e.g., a light theme and a dark theme) using Shadcn UI's theming capabilities.
Implement a theme toggle feature allowing users to switch between themes at runtime.
Ensure that the selected theme applies consistently across all pages and components in the application.
Store the user's theme preference in local storage to persist across sessions.

User Interaction:
Provide a simple, intuitive UI for users to switch between themes.
Ensure that the theme transition is smooth and does not disrupt the user experience.

Documentation:
Document your theme configuration setup, the structure of your theme files, and how themes are applied across your application in a README file.
Include comments in your code to explain any complex or non-obvious logic.

Testing:
Develop test cases to validate your theme configuration system.
Ensure that your tests cover the theme application, user interaction, and theme persistence across sessions.

Evaluation Criteria:
Evaluation will focus on code correctness, completeness, and clarity, along with documentation and test cases. Prompt and quality submissions will be viewed favorably for this and future positions.
Good Luck, Ernest
